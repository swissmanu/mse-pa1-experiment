# Observational Study "Debugging Techniques"

> This repository is part of my master's study research regarding "Debugging of RxJS-based Applications". It contains the source code for two problems used during the observational study to validate the debugging techniques software engineers apply when debugging RxJS-based programs.

## Commands

```bash
yarn                         # Install all dependencies
yarn start                   # Start Web Server and Open Problems in Browser
yarn test problem-1          # Run test for problem 1 only
yarn test problem-2          # Run test for problem 2 only
yarn test problem-1 --watch  # Rerun tests upon changes for problem 1
yarn test problem-2 --watch  # Rerun tests upon changes for problem 2
```
